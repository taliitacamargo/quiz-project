# quiz-project
 This project is a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores that I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and set my score on the board.
There were additionals such as link on the logo to the landing page so that it facilitates navigation through the app, background image
so that it looks a bit more interesting to the eyes of its users and other animations with buttons.
